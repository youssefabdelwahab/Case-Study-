Stripe is a payment services company that was incorporated in 2010 in San Francisco. It was co-founded by Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison. The growth pace in e-commerce was outstripping the growth in payemnts technology. It had been thought that the creation of Paypal would have solved alot of the issues that businesses deal with today, however that wasnt the case. Paypal still had many various restrictions on online businesses and startups. For example " once turnovers hit a certain level,Paypal automatically put the business on a 21 to 60 day rolling reserve, meaning that up to 30 per cent of a company’s revenue could be locked up for up to two months." The other choice businesses were left to choose was the traditional banking system, which was very inefficient and consisted of multiple fees. The idea of Stripe aimed to making accepting payments over the web easy. Stripe is a Saas company that develops products that allow businesses to accept and make payments online. Thier mission is to increase the GDP of the internet. The company started rolling with a $2M seed investment in 2014 and so far has generated $1.6Bn in funding over 14 rounds. It is now one of the highest valued Fintech companys worth around $35Bn.  

## BUSINESS ACTIVITIES 

In an interview John Collison stated "Stripe really did come about because we were really appalled by how hard it was to charge for things online." Businesses today are global with the development of e-commerce. They deal and interact with consumers and stakeholders from all over the world. Accepting payments globally has always been a very complicated thing. I remember back in 2008, while i was playing baseball in Kuwait. I really needed a bat, however there were no sport retailers in the country that offered them. Baseball was a very niche sport. The only way to get a baseball bat was through e-bay or an American sports retailer. Me and my father studied the idea of ordering one, however we faced an obstacle while in the payemnt section. We were very unsure and skeptical. The complexity of the process was also increased by needing to pay in USD. When a company wants to accept payments online it has to set up a merchant account which involves dealing with legacy infrstructure (banks) and many time consuming manual tasks. This process also involves many regualtions and fees. Online businesses also have to make sure they are not dealing with fradulent accounts. Stripe intially started with its main goal as payments faciltator. It has now evolved into a more broad company. It has added a few new missions to its mandate. It aims to enable online commerce , support merchant growth , and grow the internet economy. Stripe's main customers are online businesses. The global e-commerce market is estimated to be $4T this current year.

The compnay's competitive advantage comes from building a developer oriented user expierence. Brothers John and Patrick throught that in the future descion making will come from developers who handle the businesses payment system. "Its installation process is a breeze  just copy and paste seven lines of code to get up and running – and its documentation is famously clear and concise.  When Stripe first launched, it felt revolutionary that developers could switch from legacy processing systems to Stripe in a single day." Stripe is often referred to as a “developer’s payments solution,” due to their custom UI toolkit and available APIs. With these tools, you can completely customize your payments solution. Even if you’re not a developer, between the types of payments Stripe accommodates, the ways in which you can accept those payments, and the add-ons available to their platform, Stripe offers an impressive level of customization for all business owners."Stripe has been adamant about ease of use. Its installation process is a breeze – just copy and paste seven lines of code to get up and running – and its documentation is famously clear and concise. When Stripe first launched, it felt revolutionary that developers could switch from legacy processing systems to Stripe in a single day. And along with enterprises, smaller businesses that were not digital natives could integrate Stripe just as seamlessly." #Additionally, Stripe has built substantial economies of scale. Economies of scale allow Stripe to work on edge cases because they are able to spread the cost of building niche solutions across millions of customers, many of whom will benefit from Stripe’s having built a solution to a very specific problem. Switching costs are also quite tricky for consumers. Once businesses have signed up with Stripe, it begins to ask and collect customer data per transcation, building it's user base. Switching to a new payments provider would require the business to go back to every customer and ask them to fill in the information once more, and consumers dont want to got through this process. Stripe has developed a counter-positing strategy by offering a disruptor business model that traditional banks found difficult to react to. Banks have always provided the payments infrastructure, however now they risk changing their business model for many reasons. One they risk messing up their existing client base. Two, they struggle to deliver excellent products as the new entrants such as Stripe. Three, they risk incurring organizational disfunction switching up their exsisting business model. Four and finally, changing their business model would be a sign of failure and bad management. As the compnay began to grow, it shifted its focus from offering payment services only to multiple of other offerings that serve the needs of businesses. It has developed a platform named "Radar" which is a machine learning based application that allows customers to weave out fraudulent transactions. The algorithms would flag any suspicious payment and stop the system from processing the transaction. It introduced "Billing" which is an application that allows Stripe customers to invoice their clients, analyze current subscription revenues, or set up schedules on when to charge customers. "Atlas" is a service that allows customers to incorporate a business within minutes. It allows to form an LLC or C corp, create a US bank account, issue stocks/shares to co-founders and access special services for startups. "Sigma" is a data warehousing tool that allows customers to access transaction data via SQL queries. "Stripe’s bet is that by integrating more of the products that businesses need in one easy-to-implement, constantly improving solution while racing to fill gaps, it will be able to acquire and retain customers and move them to higher margin products."
   
   ## LANDSCAPE

As i mentioned before, Stripe is concentrated in the payments sector of the financial industry. It leverages this by having developed a payfac system. Payfac systems open a merchant bank account and receive a merchant ID (MID) to acquire and aggregate payments for a group of smaller merchants, typically called sub-merchants. Payfacs have embedded payment systems and register their master MID with an acquiring bank. Sub-merchants, on the other hand, are not required to register their unique MIDs—instead, transactions are aggregated under the payfac’s master MID. This is meant to reduce the complexity that sub-merchants would face setting up online payments on their own by eliminating the need for them to establish and maintain relationships with an acquiring bank, payment gateway, and other service providers.Financial partners, card networks, regulators, and acquirers are most concerned with the following when it comes to payment facilitation. 1, Controlling who is on the platform: Setting up the right onboarding processes and building trust in those processes. 2, Meeting KYC, AML, and OFAC compliance requirements: Ensuring sub-merchants are verified to control for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other risks and meeting Know Your Customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML), and the US Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) requirements. If operating internationally, there are many other regulatory bodies to consider. 3, Auditing account activity on the platform: Putting controls in place to track and mitigate high-risk financial activity on an ongoing basis. 4, Being PCI compliant: Ensuring the platform is Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant and all sub-merchants are accepting payments from customers in a compliant way.

 In this section we will talk about the recent developments geared towards Stripe's 3 main goals which are. 1, Broadly enabling online commerce. Payment processing requires confirming a buyer’s identity. That task is particularly challenging online, as it is easier to make a fraudulent purchase on the internet than it is in a physical store. In 2014, card-not-present (CNP) fraud represented 45% of total US card fraud. Fraud is an expensive line item for merchants, with every $1 of fraud costing online businesses an estimated $2.62 in recovery and resolution.Through Radar the company has been help businesses to monitor transactions in real-time and score them based on past transaction data trends. The system is more effectively able to flag potentially fraudulent transactions as it ingests more data. 2, Support Merchant Growth. As mentioned previously the company has evolved from facilitating payments. The new trend in the industry has been geared towards supporting online businesses. There are many ways that Stripe and similar companies(competitors) haven been working on this. The main effort revolves around business financing. Stripe Capital is a flexible small business loan available to existing Stripe users. The offering funds within one business day and automates repayment as a fixed percentage of daily sales. The product was launched in mid-2019, with current loan size typically between $10K – $20K. Business lending has been a growth area for rivals like Square, which launched a similar product known as Square Capital in 2014. In its Q3’19 10-Q, Square said Capital had originated 85,000 loans totaling $563M, up 38% year-over-year. Since its inception, Square Capital has originated over $5B in funds to 275K merchants. Stripe launched its Corporate Card shortly after announcing Stripe Capital. The product offers business cards to existing Stripe customers with dynamic credit limits, real-time expense reporting, and personalized rewards, including 2% cashback in a business’ top 2 spending categories each month. Several startups are competing for market share in the global corporate card market, which has been dominated by American Express for decades. Brex is one company, raising $280M in less than two years at a $2.6B valuation. The startup names SoFi, Airbnb, Flexport, and Outdoor Voices as customers. Utah-based Divvy, an expense management platform for SMBs, is another.


## Stripe and its Competitiors

1. SQUARE 
Square, Inc. is an American financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California. Square is the closest competitor to Stripe as it offers similar features, however the company has it's differences. The company started as POS hardware systems provider that could enhace credit card readibility and accesability. The company has then evolced to offering software payments products to online businesses as well as support services such as inventory management, marketing and fraud detection. The company also has a very similar fee structure as Stripe

2. Braintree 

Braintree is another company that lies on the same business model as Stripe. It is a division of Paypal. Braintee is a merchant account provider. e merchant account provider fronts you the cash you’re due from those transactions, minus their fees, so you don’t need to wait until your customer pays off their credit card bill to get paid. The difference between Stripe and Braintree is that Stripe aggregates all their sellers into one large merchant account rather than offering individiual ones like Braintree. The company also offers fraud detection tools , data warehousing and a similar fee structure. 




## RESULTS

Stripe has not disclosed its metrics, however it has stated that processes billions of dollars per year.Today, Stripe allows merchants to operate online businesses in 34 countries, with plans to reach 40 in the next few months, representing roughly 70% of the global economy. Through Stripe, businesses are able to accept payments from any country in 135+ currencies.  A 2018 IDC survey found that companies using Stripe’s payments platform reported a 24% lower operational cost relative to traditional online payment processing. That figure more than doubled for companies processing more than $5M per year. On top of that, customers saw an average of 6.7% higher revenue by running on Stripe.  The company has pursing steady growth ramping up its private market investments. Stripe has been involved in several deals to startups that can help expand Stripe’s presence in developing and international markets.Cuenca, a Mexico City-based mobile banking and payments app for Mexico’s underbanked population (most recent round: $7.4M Series A, 2019). Paystack, a Nigerian-based digital payments platform that bears a striking resemblance to Stripe ($8M Series A, 2018). PayMongo, a Philippines-based company that helps companies accept payments online ($2.7M Seed VC, 2019). Rapyd, a London-based global payments network and “fintech-as-a-service” company ($120M across 2 Series C tranches, 2019). With 5 out of 6 new internet users coming online from areas outside of North America and Western Europe, global expansion is a key priority for Stripe. The company has taken an aggressive but strategic approach towards new market entry, expanding globally through its open engineering and easy integration. Global expansion can provide Stripe with more customers, more diverse datasets, and the ability to build more effective applications and products on top of its payment stack. As Stripe takes on more payment volume from existing customers, while also bringing new customers on board from new markets, the flywheel effect in Stripe’s ecosystem can really start to take off — presenting the company with opportunities for new revenue streams across a broader range of financial services products.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

The next logical step for the payments industry or Stripe in my opinion would be incroporating blockchain and distributed ledger technology. I beleive that if Stripe were to evolve their payments business model leverage blockchain and DLT technologies it would gain an upperhand in the payments industry. While its current payment facilitation system offers alot of efficiencies, using blockchain and DLT could help them pass alot of the regulations and intermedieries that banks apply. 


 First lets talk about what these techonologies are and what they do. Blockchain technology provides a way for untrusted parties to come to agreement on the state of a database, without using a middleman. By providing a ledger that nobody administers, a blockchain could provide specific financial services — like payments, or securitization — without using a middleman, like a bank. Blockchain and DLT could offer a lot of benefits that impact Stripe's current business model. For one DLT and Blockchain will facilatate payments at a faster rate than bank and due to their shared aspect that increases efficiency will also allow for fees to be much lower that what is currently available on the market. This will enable clearance and settlement systems to reduce their operational costs and enhance real-time transactions.Bitcoin transactions can take from up to 30 minutes to 16 hours in extreme cases. This is much faster than the average of 3 days that banks take. At the current state, a simple bank transfer has to bypass a complicated system of intermediaries before it reaches any kind of destination. Any bank transfer is executed through SWFIT at the current state. The centralized SWIFT protocol doesn’t actually send the funds, it simply sends the payment orders. The actual money is then processed through a system of intermediaries. Blockchain technology, which serves as a decentralized “ledger” of transactions, could disrupt this state of play. Rather than using SWIFT to reconcile each financial institution’s ledger, an interbank blockchain could keep track of all transactions publicly and transparently. That means that instead of having to rely on a network of custodial services and correspondent banks, transactions could be settled directly on a public blockchain. 

Additionally as Stripe recently ventured into the loans and credits sector, Blockchain and DLT will also will have a positive impact on this business area. Blockchain enabled lending offers a more secure way of offering personal loans to a large pool of consumers and would make the loan process cheaper, more efficient and more secure. When one applies for a bank loan, the bank goes through the process of evaluating the risk of you not being able to paybak the loan. They do this by looking at factors like your credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and home ownership status. To get this information, they have to access your credit report provided by one of three major credit agencies: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax.It is stated that 1 in 5 Americans have an error in their credit score that negativley impacts their ability to get a loan. It is also worthwhile to note that having all this information concentrated creates a lot of vulnerability issues. Alternative lending using blockchain technology offers a cheaper, more efficient, and more secure way of making personal loans to a broader pool of consumers. With a cryptographically secure, decentralized registry of historical payments, consumers could apply for loans based on a global credit score.
